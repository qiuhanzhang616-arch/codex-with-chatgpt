# Codex with ChatGPT

> ChatGPT thinks. Codex works.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Having trouble?** First ask Codex to **“Update Codex with ChatGPT”** and try again. Updating to the latest version resolves most known issues.

## The problem

ChatGPT Plus/Pro web quota sits idle while your coding agent burns
scarce API/Codex tokens on planning and review. This project moves the
thinking to the subscription you already pay for; Codex only executes.
No API keys, no reverse proxy — official web UI plus a read-only MCP bridge.

## What it is

Use the ChatGPT web app as the planning and review brain for your
Codex coding sessions, while Codex keeps full ownership of execution. Your
repository is never uploaded: ChatGPT reads exactly the lines it needs through
a secure, OAuth-protected, **read-only** MCP connection to your current
workspace.

## One-paste install

Don't know git, Node, or terminals? You don't need to. Copy the
paragraph below, paste it to your coding agent (Codex), and go grab a coffee:

```text
Please install and configure "Codex with ChatGPT" for me, fully automatically.
I am a non-technical user — do everything yourself:

1. Check the environment: git and Node.js >= 20 must be available. Install
   anything missing yourself (macOS: Homebrew, Windows: winget). Also install
   cloudflared.
2. Download: clone https://github.com/XiaoDuoYa/codex-with-chatgpt into
   ~/codex-with-chatgpt (if it already exists, git pull to update).
3. Build: inside that folder run `corepack pnpm install` then `corepack pnpm build`.
4. Install the Skill: copy skill/SKILL.md to
   ~/.codex/skills/codex-with-chatgpt/SKILL.md, and update the line
   "The codex-with-chatgpt checkout lives at:" to the actual clone path.
5. First-time setup: follow the SKILL.md "first-time setup" workflow
   (run c2c setup, configure the ChatGPT connector in the BUILT-IN browser,
   enter the pairing code). Never open a third-party browser.
6. Only interrupt me for logins (ChatGPT / Cloudflare), CAPTCHAs or 2FA —
   and give me exactly ONE action at a time.
7. When done, show me the ✓ checklist and confirm the file-read test passed.
   I don't know what MCP, OAuth, tunnels or ports are. Don't explain them.
   If anything breaks, fix it yourself first.
```


**Updates** — The Skill checks GitHub once a day and updates itself when a
new version is released; no action is needed. You can also say
"Update Codex with ChatGPT" at any time.

---

## Install → Setup → Use (manual)

1. Install the Codex Skill: copy `skill/` to `~/.codex/skills/codex-with-chatgpt/`.
2. Tell Codex: **"Set up Codex with ChatGPT."**
3. Use Codex normally: **"Use Codex with ChatGPT to implement XXX."**

That's the whole manual. You don't need to know what MCP, OAuth, tunnels,
ports or localhost are — Codex configures everything automatically and you
just see:

```
Codex with ChatGPT

✓ Project detected
✓ Workspace Bridge started
✓ Secure connection established
✓ ChatGPT connected
✓ File read test passed

Ready.
```

The only steps that may need you: logging into ChatGPT (and, if you want a
stable hostname, logging into Cloudflare once). A **new** workspace also asks
you to create a ChatGPT Project (collection) once — pick **project-only
memory**, name it after the workspace. If the sidebar has no Projects row,
hover **Chats**, open the … menu, and choose **Organize by project**. Codex
then saves that collection link and starts chats from that page. Existing
workspaces that already have a C2C chat stay on the old one-conversation
style until you ask to switch.

### Optional stable hostname

The default public address is a temporary Cloudflare URL. It changes when the
bridge restarts, and Codex repairs ChatGPT by deleting that workspace's
connector and adding it again.

If you have a Cloudflare account and a domain already on Cloudflare, first-time
setup (and the next coding session, once) will ask whether you want a stable
hostname such as `c2c-<project>.your-domain.com`. That path opens a browser so
you can authorize Cloudflare. After that, the ChatGPT connector keeps working
across restarts. If you skip it, or the login fails, Codex stays on the temporary
address — same features, just a slower repair.

Credentials stay in the OS app state directory, not in the project.

```

- **Control plane (Computer Use)**: Codex and ChatGPT exchange tiny structured
  `[C2C]` state messages — `INIT → PLAN → EXECUTED → REVIEW → DONE`. No diffs,
  no logs, no file bodies are ever pasted.
- **Data plane (MCP)**: ChatGPT pulls what it needs itself through 9 read-only
  tools: `workspace_info`, `list_directory`, `read_file`, `search_workspace`,
  `git_status`, `git_diff`, `test_status`, `execution_summary`,
  `execution_output`.
- **Independent review**: after Codex executes, ChatGPT inspects the actual
  git diff and test records through MCP — it never trusts "all tests passed"
  claims blindly.

## Security model (short version)

- **Read-only by construction**: write/delete/shell/commit tools simply do not
  exist on the server. No prompt injection can enable them.
- **One workspace = one boundary**: every token is bound to a single workspace;
  path containment uses canonical realpaths (symlink/`../`/absolute-path escapes
  are all blocked and tested).
- **Sensitive files never leave**: `.env*`, keys, SSH, credentials are denied by
  default (`.env.example` allowed); `.c2cignore` adds your own rules.
- **Knowing the URL grants nothing**: the public MCP endpoint requires OAuth 2.1
  (PKCE S256, dynamic client registration, rotating refresh tokens). Without a
  token: 401. Wrong workspace: 403.
- **The model never sees long-lived credentials**: the only secret that ever
  touches a browser is a one-time pairing code (5-minute TTL, 5 attempts,
  rate-limited, destroyed on use).

## For developers

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build          # -> dist/, exposes the `c2c` bin
pnpm test           # vitest: 150 tests (path security, OAuth, pairing, MCP e2e)

c2c setup           # bridge + tunnel + pairing code, all in one
c2c sandbox-allow   # whitelist the settings dir in Codex (macOS + Windows)
c2c status / doctor / pair / unpair / logs / stop
```

Requirements: Node.js >= 20, git. `cloudflared` for the public connection
(auto-detected; the Skill installs it for you). If QUIC is blocked, set
`C2C_TUNNEL_PROTOCOL=http2` and restart the bridge.
